# Homeboze
## An online directory site for Real Estate.

> This project was developed as a learning project, part of the Microverse curriculum. This project is about building a static page for an online directory of real estate properties. The goal was to build the page to be as identical in the somewhat vague [specification](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE).
